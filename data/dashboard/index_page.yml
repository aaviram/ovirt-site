          Red Hat's Open Source and Standards (OSAS) group, working with [Bitergia](http://www.bitergia.com), is capturing interesting data from some of the upstream projects with which Red Hat is deeply involved. On this page, you'll find various vital signs from the oVirt project.

          These figures are yet another way to provide transparency and insight into the open source communities with which OSAS works, but should not be used as a final or complete aspect of a community's health.
